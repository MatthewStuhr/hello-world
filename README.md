# hello-world
My first repository

Hey everyone!

Just starting out to learn how to code and about developing. I'm 27 years old and was a competitive siwmmer for 18 years up until graduating college. I have worked in the insurance industry and retail business but believe that coding will play a big part in the future of everyone's lives.

I have lived in California my whole life, living in the city of Santa Rosa which is about one hour north from San Francisco.

I have started to become really interested in blockchain technology which has led me into learning how to code.

Other than that I hope to learn as much as possible within these 100 days of code!
